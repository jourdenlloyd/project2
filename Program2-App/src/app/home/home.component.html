    <h2>Welcome to PawPath©</h2>
    <p> PawPath© is a grassroots organization, built from the ground up by dog people for dog people. Originally a
        neighborhood group of kids doing a summer job, PawPath© grew by word-of-mouth and old-fashioned paper fliers
        into a dog walking agency. As time and technology went on, however, we could no longer rely on word-of-mouth
        alone to keep our business alive. So we now invite you to connect with us on our new website.
    </p>
    <p>We understand that dogs are part of the family too. We work with Walkers™ and pet parents to help ensure that
        your dogs get the exercise they need, whenever they need it.
    </p>
    <p> PawPath© offers convenient dog walking services through our website and pet insurance while your fur-babies are
        in our care. We also provide accidental injury insurance for our Walkers™.
    </p>
    PawPath© is a community you can trust. Reviews connect pet parents' experiences and Walkers'™ hard work.
